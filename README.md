# Learning Projects

This is a repository for several small projects, built by me (Ricardo Fleury).  My intention in building these projects is to advance my software development skills through the design and implementation of original solutions to problems I find intellectually interesting and educationally valuable.

All of the projects are my creation from scratch, meaning none are built based on tutorials or other design aids.
